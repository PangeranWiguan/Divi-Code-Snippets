# No Sharing Term Modal

This code is intended to tell visitors that the page they are currently viewing is set to "no-index" and "no-crawl" to prevent search engine from indexing this page because it is not for public viewing and only intended for the person the person shared the link to.

# How To Use?

1. Use Divi Code Module.
2. Copy the CSS code from [style.css](/No%20Index%20No%20Sharing%20Modal/style.css) and paste it into custom CSS (Free Form) in the Divi Code module.
3. Copy the code from [the-modal.html](/No%20Index%20No%20Sharing%20Modal/the-modal.html) and paste it into the "Text" of the Divi Code module.
4. Copy the code from [srcipt.js](/No%20Index%20No%20Sharing%20Modal/script.js) and paste it into the "Text" of the Divi Code module, right after the "&lt;&#47;div&gt;" code from #3.
5. Save

# Customisation

You can edit the content from [the-modal.html](/No%20Index%20No%20Sharing%20Modal/the-modal.html) and paste it into the "Text" of the Divi Code module to suite your message.
